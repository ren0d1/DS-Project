% of fires in dry eucalypt forest. 
% justification: Eucalypts are iconic Australian forest trees. Ninety-two million hectares of the Eucalypt forest type occurs in Australia, and forms three-quarters of the total native forest area. The term 'eucalypt' includes approximately 900 species in the three genera Eucalyptus, Corymbia and Angophora.
