-----------
Detect fire - H --> working on stats
notify detected fire
kill fire when notified
check sign of life - R
replace dead sensors - R
include temp, humidity in fire prob
include relative humidity in fire spread and temperature
	temperature goes up, then rel hum goes down but if rel hum is high then fire 'burn'/spreads slower
change dead sensors to be detected after x time not available and not instantly
do analytics

----------
OPTIONAL |
----------
update weather variations
include temp, humidity and wind in fire prob + spread factor
create network packets decoding problems and handle them
simulate how the "Main" device gets contacted for notification and how it then contacts the base
